# Web-crafts

Use the native JavaScript language to create lightweight web plugins.

This project provides some common Web plugins, such as pattern locks, picture carousels, and so on. Since there may be a lot of plugins in the future, I do not want to create a separate project for each plugin, so put them under the same project. But these plugins are independent, there is no impact between each other. In each project folder will have a corresponding document for details.

Each plugin is developed by native JavaScript, and because of my low level of code, these plugins are better suited for learning rather than into production practice.
